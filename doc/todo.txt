- add an option to only scan manually (don't propmtime in the background)

- add a 'demo' that sets up a temp dir with subdirs and files that are not propagated, then
  show the user how it's better when the mtimes are propagated.

- create a test case where a path points to a directory that doesn't actually exist.
  Right now, I think propmtime just exits (however there doesn't seem to be an
  error message in the logs).
