- add a 'demo' that sets up a temp dir with subdirs and files that are not propagated, then
  show the user how it's better when the mtimes are propagated.

- create a test case where a path points to a directory that doesn't actually exist.

- use this code to detect a preferences DB schema change (instead of versions):

    except sqlite3.DatabaseError as e:
        # catch-all if the DB has an issue or the schema has changed - remove it
        log.warning('DatabaseError (removing) : %s' % str(e))
        if conn:
            conn.close()
        os.remove(db_path)

    can this be done in SqlAlchemy?
